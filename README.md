# World_Weather_Analysis
Mod-6
# Overview 
The goal here is to help Jack with the testing of a new travel App. Using our existing knowledge of calling API’s and building off of it. We are asked to add some descriptions to the previously made weather data. Then, we’ll test out some new input functions, to filter out types of weather based on preferences. In order to identify new, and specific travel destinations. As well as places to stay. From there, narrow it down to a potential destination site. With four cities as an example to create an itinerary, and use google's API map directions to create a travel route.
